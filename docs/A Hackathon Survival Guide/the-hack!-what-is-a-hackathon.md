There are different types of Hackathon, but many in the Ethereum and wider open source world aim to do one of the following:


- Competing for sponsor prizes by incorporating their technologies into a project.
- Contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem with novel or amazing ideas, or contributing to existing projects.

## Help?!? But I've never been to a Hackathon before!

That's fine, everyone brings valuable skills to a hackathon, and any hackathon worth attending should welcome you, and should provide a place you can ask questions.

## Do I have to be a developer?

No! In fact, hackathons often need people who bring different skills. Whether you want to help as a designer, project manager, give UX advice, write documentation, or something else. Often the projects that do well at hackathons are the ones that focus on more than just code.

## Read and follow guidelines
Hackathons often have guidelines for submissions and prizes, make sure you read and follow them to be considered. Another important aspect of a hackathon is a "code of conduct" that sets out how people are expected to behave to each other during the event. Make sure you read and follow it!
