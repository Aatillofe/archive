# Company/Project Name and Description

**Zerion** is building a trustless bank for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). We aim at transforming the decentralized finance experience to drive the next wave of adoption of blockchain-based finance. Instead of relying on a third party to manage their assets (such as through traditional banking and existing FinTech), Zerion users keep full control over their assets and execute common banking services with minimal fees.

# Bounty 1 Overview: The best financial product for DeFi

**Description:** 2019 promises to be the year of decentralized finance (DeFi). To win this bounty, create a novel application of programmable financial primitives. Design your own trustless financial product on top of Ethereum by using protocols such as MakerDAO, Uniswap, Kyber, etc. The final product should be a DApp or set of smart contracts that integrate at least one of the DeFi protocols. 

Examples:
1. Arbitrage of MakerDAO borrowing (0.5% on DAI borrowing) and Compound (~3% on DAI lending) within a single transaction.
2. Decentralized Exchanges liquidity aggregator — a smart contract that finds the best available rate through 0x, Kyber, Uniswap, etc., and makes a trade. 
3. Insurance for MakerDAO CDPs — a smart contract that automatically deposits ETH to risky CDPs to save them from liquidation for a small commission. 

**Prize Amount:** $1,000
