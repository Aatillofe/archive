# Company/Project Name and Description

**SKALE Labs** 

SKALE provides an easy to use layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum Dapps. In less than 60 seconds you can access and connect a SKALE Chain to a web 3 environment.

# Bounty 1 Overview: Rockies SKALER

**Description:** The most impressive scaling submission based on judgment criteria detailed below

- **1st Place Prize Amount:** $2,000
- **Honorable Mention:** $1,000 each to up to three teams


# Resources/Links:
- https://github.com/skalenetwork/hackathon

# Requirements (e.g., link to open source code)
- Brief 3-5 minute presentation describing scaling issue and how SKALE was used to solve the issue
- Use of a SKALE Chain in solution
- Link to open source code

# Judging Criteria

Show the world what is possible when we aren’t encumbered with scaling issues. Run smart contracts and transactions at high speeds. Prizes will be awarded to teams based on the following criteria:

**Powerful scaling use cases:** show off the power of SKALE and show how decentralized smart contract execution in Layer 2 can make an impact on the world

**Creativity:** This is a new domain. We appreciate creativity and innovative thinking. Now that the constraints are off, show the world what Ethereum can do!

**Effort over perfection:** We love hustle. We love effort. We are prioritizing effort over perfection for the ETHDenver hackathon. Work hard and be rewarded rather than be punished for not being perfect. When we hear your pitch, please tell us about your effort. We’ll also look directly at your code to see the fruits of your labor.

Advancements in both smart contract complexity and computation power vastly increase the types of dApps that are feasible with solidity. While we aren’t expecting someone to be running ADMM Optimization over the weekend, we do hope that people no longer have a fear of running out of gas or using loops in their code.
