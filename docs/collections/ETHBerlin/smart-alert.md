title: Smart Alert
summary: Excellent project concept attempting to make keeping track of on-chain smart contract vulnerabilities and general behavior as simple as possible. Strong opportunity for moving forward with a traditional SaaS business orientated towards developer tools for live main-net developers, encouraging robust maintenance of contracts post-deployment. Looking forward to what the team can assemble in a longer time frame! - Bryant Eisenbach (SecurETH) https-//devpost.com/software/smart-alert-s5p1zw SmartAler
