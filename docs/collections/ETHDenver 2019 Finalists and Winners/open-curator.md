# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
We designed and developed a TCR standard and a first simple implementation of the standard. Creating these components was the first milestone for developing a dApp thats allows user to curate multiple sources of content into a single place. Open Curator allows users to create new customized curating lists that fit to multiple use-case and also allows them to integrate existing TCRs that implements the standard.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
TCR smart contracts were developed using Solidity 0.4.24, Open Zeppelin and ZeppelinOS. The dapp was built on top of Zeppelin new Zepkit using React.js (material-ui, rimble ui, redux, redux-saga, redux-router), we also integrated the awesome SDK of Portis web3.

# All Bounties Completed/Incorporated

**Zeppelin** - Bounty 2 - We used the ZepKit to kick-start our project, ZeppelinOS for deploying our TCR Factory and our smart contracts relied on some OpenZeppelin contracts for bootstrapping and security. (planning to PR our SimpleTCR contract).

**Portis** - Bounty 1 & Bounty 2 - We integrated with Portis to provide a frictionless UX, by customizing Zeppelin's ZepKit that came out of the box with Metamask so that Portis' SDK was used as a default provider.
