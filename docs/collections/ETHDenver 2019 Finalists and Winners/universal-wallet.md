## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
We are solving the on-boarding problem, by radically reducing amount of steps a new user needs to follow in order to start interacting with the Ethereum network. All a user needs to do is:
- pick a name
- enter card information
- boom! - done

We utilize a number of technologies to make this possible:
- we always provide users with the option to purchase dai (to avoid volatility problem)
- universal login - to provide secure distributed storage and usability on multiple devices
- meta transactions - to allow users to pay for transaction gas costs with dai (so that user needs no knowledge of ethereum at all)
- counterfactual deployment, so a user is provided an account before making their first transaction



## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
dai, counterfactual deployment, create2, multisig, metaransactions 
Also React, Solidity, ethers.js, waffle

## Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)
