## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
A transparent, equal opportunity marketplace to connect workers with sponsors, for job opportunities, and a micro-lending network (ETH lend) for training and career development.  JobSimple is built to eliminate the need for corrupt recruitment agencies that exploit migrant workers. We aim to fight income inequality and human rights abuses one job placement at a time. 

See our Read.Me file on GitHub for the Sustainable Development Goals targeted by this project. 

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
A standard web application built with Vue.js (2.6) Framework  that provides a seamless and simple user experience so that users of all ability levels can make sense of the workflow without difficulty.

Authentication is integrated with Fortmatic so that users can be onboarded without the need for MetaMask. Fortmatic uses Phone Numbers for identity and auto-creates wallets for ease of use.

Google Firebase is used for metadata storage

Integration with Imbrex’s Tegula Platform was attempted to use the listing market place for storing job listing in the Ethereum blockchain

Lending capability is provided by integrating with Aave’s ETHLend platform. This provides capability for workers to request loans from the ETHLend community at low interest rates.

Other Frameworks : Bootstrap, jQuery, Web3, TypeScript, Node.js, Webpack, HTML, CSS, Vuex, Vue Router
