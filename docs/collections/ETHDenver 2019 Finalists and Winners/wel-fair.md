## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Wel-fair provides a marketplace where underprivileged citizens can fulfill government-specified bounties and get rewarded for their contributions in the form of welfare benefits. By re-directing part of its local community service budget, the government can incentivize lower-income communities to fulfill tasks such as park services, construction and security. Onboarding citizens onto a BloomID will also cut down high recurring admin cost in eligibility certification and issuance.
