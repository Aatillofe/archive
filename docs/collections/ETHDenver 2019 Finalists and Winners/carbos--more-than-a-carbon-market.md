## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Carbos uses public data and Ethereum’s decentralized ecosystem to allow both individuals to quantify carbon negative actions at **any scale**, and carbon offset investors to purchase NFTs which maintain a specific **frame of reference**.

We believe this solution, which relays incentives directly to individuals, is the only way to develop the individual capacity-building necessary to implement carbon-negative adaptation, mitigation, and development policies.  By allowing agencies to offset emissions through direct investments in a specific community or a specific action, Carbos facilitates per capita reductions in air pollution, waste generation, deforestation, etc. ignored by the traditional carbon offset registry model.

Carbos removes the barrier to entry imposed by traditional carbon offset providers, creating an environment in which governments, businesses, and individuals can work together on climate action agendas.
