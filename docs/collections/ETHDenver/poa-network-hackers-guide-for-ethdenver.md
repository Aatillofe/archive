# POA Network Hackers Guide for ETHDenver 


  POA is proud to announce that we will be sponsoring
[ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com) for a second consecutive year! Last
year we witnessed the developer community [rally together and focus on
building several amazing dApps on our
infrastructure](https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-at-ethdenver-a-recap-88f64b18dee7).
We saw many inspiring projects and submissions and had the opportunity
to showcase the prototype version of our POA20 Bridge.

Since then, we have released a full suite of open source developer tools
to advance the Ethereum ecosystem. We’re excited to see how hackers and
\#BUILDers leverage these tools to create something new!

-   [BlockScout](https://blockscout.com) — Our open source block
    explorer that utilizes Elixir for its scalability and fault-tolerant
    systems to provide fast, secure, and easy to use transaction
    processing. BlockScout features an [API
    1](https://blockscout.com/poa/dai/api_docs) that is easy to connect
    with to view and confirm transactions and smart contract
    interactions.
-   [xDai
    Chain](https://forum.poa.network/t/xdai-chain-official-announcement/1779/4)
    — We have partnered with MakerDAO to create the first ever
    blockchain where the native currency of the chain is USD-stable.
    xDai Chain, an Ethereum compatible sidechain with Dai as the native
    currency of the network, combines POA Network’s interoperability
    technology along with MakerDAO’s Dai, the permissionless,
    crypto-collateralized USD-stable coin.
-   [ERC20 to ERC20 TokenBridge
    2](https://forum.poa.network/t/introducing-the-erc20-to-erc20-tokenbridge/1783)
    — This bridge allows users to transfer ERC20 tokens from one
    Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based network to another EVM based
    network within a single wallet.

We’ve seen first hand the power of hackathons to generate new and
exciting ideas. Most recently, we participated in the Status
\#CryptoLife Hackathon in Prague, Czech Republic where developers
[created applications on our xDai chain including a payment platform and
a virtual jukebox
1](https://medium.com/poa-network/cryptolife-recap-looking-at-the-poa-network-projects-513a1a66c8d3).

Who will be there from the POA team?
------------------------------------

At EthDenver, POA will be represented by various team members including:

-   [Igor Barinov](https://forum.poa.network/u/igorbarinov) - When he is
    not helping hackers and developers, **POA’s tech lead** will be
    participating in **infrastructure and scalability** related panels
    and workshops.
-   [Viktor Baranov](https://forum.poa.network/u/viktorbaranov) - POA
    Core developer Viktor Baranov will be helping the hackers with any
    issues or technical problems they may have.
-   [Andrew Gross](https://forum.poa.network/u/AndrewG) - Technical
    writer, Ethereum dev call contributor and Denver native will be
    presenting the POA keynote on the first evening of ETHDenver.
-   [Andrew Cravenho](https://forum.poa.network/u/andrewcravenho) -
    BlockScout project lead will be at ETHDenver alongside the POA team
    where he will be presenting BlockScout’s latest features and future
    roadmap.

Alongside the official POA team, you will find **POA validators** [Henry
Vishnevsky](https://forum.poa.network/u/henryvishnevsky/summary) and
[Alexey Emelyanov](https://forum.poa.network/u/alexem/summary) and two
of **POA’s official ambassadors** [Sky
Minert](https://forum.poa.network/u/Sky-POA/summary) and [Manuel
Garcia](https://forum.poa.network/u/mgarcia/summary). You will find them
at the POA booth where they will be rocking and giving away official POA
swag!

Our team members, validators and ambassadors will be ready and available
to help you develop and deploy your DApp to one of our networks. If you
are looking for help now, or just want to familiarize yourself with our
tools, we welcome any questions in our
[forum](https://forum.poa.network) or in our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SwbdEAS).

A main success criteria of any submission we receive will be a
successful deployment to either the xDai Chain or POA Network. But not
to worry! Deploying to either of these networks is as easy as can be.

Where can I find the developer docs and resources?
