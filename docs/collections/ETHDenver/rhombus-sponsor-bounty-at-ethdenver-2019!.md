# Rhombus - Sponsor Bounty at ETHDenver 2019!

# Company/Project Name and Description

**Rhombus**

Rhombus connects your dapp with real-world data.

# Bounty 1 Overview: Oracle 

**Description:** Best application of a Rhombus oracle

**Prize Amount:** 
- First place: $1,000
- Second place: $750
- Third place: $500
- Fourth place: $250

# Resources/Links:

- Weâ€™ll release several additional oracles as the hackathon approaches and can add custom oracles for your dapp upon request.

# Additional Information
The first 15 projects that register with us and commit to using a Rhombus oracle in their dapp will receive $100, even if they don't place in the top 4 - as long as they successfully complete a dapp and integrate one of our oracles. Projects after the first 15 will receive a spot on our waitlist, and if any of the first 15 projects aren't able to successfully build dapps integrating Rhombus oracles, their $100 will be allocated to the waitlisted teams in order.

# Requirements (e.g., link to open source code)
