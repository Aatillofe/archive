- Filters, pagination, sorting
- Subscriptions to data updates

### Prizes Offered

Unsure at time of writing, [keep an eye on the blog](https://medium.com/graphprotocol).

### Getting Started

Install with Yarn:

```bash
sudo yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

And create a project:

```bash
graph init <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH> <DIRECTORY>
```
