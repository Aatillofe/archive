### New Releases

We have a few piping hot development treats this week, just in time for developers to unleash their creativity at the ETHDenver hackathon:

1. Rhombus will unveil a Truffle Box that lets you test against our oracles in your local environment: https://github.com/RhombusNetwork/lighthouse-local

2. We will provide lighthouse oracle contracts that you can read to inject quality data into your project's contracts: https://blog.rhombus.network/BUIDL-Resources

3. If you come to our booth, we can even build you a custom oracle to match your project needs.

Learn more about these developments [here](https://blog.rhombus.network/).

### And we have bounties for ETHDenver

These prizes will be awarded for best oracle usage...

First place: $1,000

Second place: $750

Third place: $500

Fourth place: $250

Honorable mentions ... see "Additional Info" below 

### How to register your project to qualify for bounties:
Send a message to @rhombusCEO on Telegram with your name, project, and oracle you're gonna use.

### Resources/Links:
Github: https://github.com/RhombusNetwork

Technical docs: https://docs.rhombus.network

Example Lighthouse oracle (ETH/USD):
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x7ce662974fbb9b590c60dbf99f078120405ff0b9#readContract

Weâ€™ll release several additional oracles as the hackathon approaches and can add custom oracles for your dapp upon request.

### Additional Information
The first 15 projects that register with us and commit to using a Rhombus oracle in their dapp will receive $100, even if they don't place in the top 4 - as long as they successfully complete a dapp and integrate one of our oracles. Projects after the first 15 will receive a spot on our waitlist, and if any of the first 15 projects aren't able to successfully build dapps integrating Rhombus oracles, their $100 will be allocated to the waitlisted teams in order.
