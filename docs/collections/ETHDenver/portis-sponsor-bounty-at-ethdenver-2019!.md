## Company/Project Name and Description

## **Portis**

By embedding the [Portis SDK](https://github.com/portis-project/web-sdk) with a couple of lines of code, DApp developers allow their users to enjoy a built-in web3-capable wallet in their existing browser, no installation required. And thanks to its end-to-end encryption architecture, users maintain absolute control over their private keys, all through a simple and familiar email and password login method.

## Bounty 1 Overview: üõ¥ "Take 'er for a spin!"
**Description:**  If you created a functional DApp as part of the ETHDenver 2019 Hackathon, which runs on a live environment ([deploying for free is super easy nowadays](https://zeit.co/now)) and you integrated Portis into it as its default or fallback web3 provider, please claim one of the bounties we opened on [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?bounty_type=feature&network=mainnet&idx_status=open&order_by=-web3_created&org=Portis) by issuing a PR with a link to your DApp. If all the above conditions are met, then you will be rewarded the ETH in the bounty.

It's our way of giving you a little gas money, so you can deploy to mainnet and play around with your DApp there. Or use it to buy an NFT for charity on [RadiCards](https://radi.cards/). Whatever tickles your fancy.

## Bounty 2 Overview: üèé "Lambos on the Moon"
**Description:** We will be looking for DApps created in the Hackathon that have taken our vision to heart. That have decided to utilize the frictionless experience provided by Portis to build a DApp with the mainstream crowd in mind.
