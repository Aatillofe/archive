# Get started with ZeppelinOS!


To help you get prepared for all the hacking at #ETHDenver this year, we wanted to put together a quick toolkit to help you get hacking as quickly and easily (and securely!) as possible.


We are offering some [sweet bounties](https://kauri.io/article/63eaa33cf5b54a43a7591beea913f179/v2/zeppelin-sponsor-bounty-at-ethdenver-2019!) this year so check them out as well!

- Includes [OpenZeppelin](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenzeppelin.org%2F) as an EVM package.
- Upgradeable smart contracts with [ZeppelinOS](https://zeppelinos.org/).
- Includes [Infura](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finfura.io%2F) setup for easy deployments & connection.
