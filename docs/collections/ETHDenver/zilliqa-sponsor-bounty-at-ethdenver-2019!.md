# Zilliqa - Sponsor Bounty at ETHDenver 2019!

![](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmc79a5i7zjzBkgXSJFyNFsdQcYCpTARoxcbDoysyzRr5t)


## Company/Project Name and Description

**Zilliqa**

Zilliqa is a scalable smart contract platform that aims to tackle the congestion issue plaguing the blockchain industry. Zilliqa utilizes a sharded architecture to achieve parallel processing of transactions while maintaining a large number of public nodes, resulting in its ability to reach higher throughput and process more complex computations.

## Bounty 1 Overview: Cross-chain atomic swap between Zilliqa and Ethereum blockchains

**Description:** Transfer it! Build a time-locked based atomic swap protocol between Zilliqa and Ethereum blockchains. You may use an off-chain oracle to verify that time-locked transactions on either Zilliqa and Ethereum has been processed.

**Prize Amount:** $2,000

## Resources/Links:

- zilliqa-js - A web3 Javascript library to interact with Zilliqa nodes to transfer ZILs and deploy/call smart contracts [https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library]
- Kaya - A RPC server that simulates a blockchain behaviour. Similar to Ganache [https://github.com/Zilliqa/kaya]
- Scilla - A safe-by-design smart contract programming language [https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla]
- Scilla language documentation [https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]
- JSON-RPC API documentation [https://apidocs.zilliqa.com/]

## Bounty 2 Overview: Cross-chain communication between Ethereum and Zilliqa

**Description:** The future of decentralised web lies in the ability for blockchain to communicate and interact with one another. Build a tool to allow blockchain interoperability, where users can make transactions and transfer data fluidly between Ethereum and Zilliqa. There are many reasons where someone might want this feature as every blockchain is unique. For example, Zilliqa is a high-throughput and scalable blockchain which allow for lower transaction fees. So get creative and scale your imagination!

**Prize Amount:** $3,000
