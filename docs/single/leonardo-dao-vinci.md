## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Excited by the prospect of computationally generated art, we saw the opportunity for a project which combines this with the decentralisation potential which blockchain technology brings. Running our project as a DAO offers opportunities to reward our users and community. This is done with profit-sharing in the sales of the artwork on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), without middlemen being involved.
We wanted to build a project that would be engaging for new users to the blockchain space, and would allow them to enter the world of crypto without having to go through an exchange.
