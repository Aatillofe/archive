# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
I have begun working on an intriguing project that will allow peer to peer exchange or digital content in a secure decentralized manner. In essence, the way this works is a content creator creates his or her content, encrypts it and uploads it to IPFS while at the same time listing it on a content marketplace for a price. Any interested counterpart, who will only have access to metadata associated with the content can send eth to the content creator, the content creator then decrypts the originally encrypted content, encrypts it again with the public key of the content purchase, rehashes that on IPFS and so ownership now transfers over the content purchaser. Target users and use cases would include - independent music producers (at the mercy of Youtube, Spotify etc), bloggers, writers, and notoriously even might be of utility to whistleblowers and political activists, who are mostly at the mercy of centrally controlled channels of communication. I want to say though that is not a political project, it is merely an experiment to see whether it can unlock the true potential of free informational exchange between human beings. Much work remains to be done in building incentive schemes to prevent malicious behaviour on this platform.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
IPFS, Javascript, Ethereum - Solidity. No server backend or middle tiers.
The entire encryption and decryption of files is handled completely by a javascript client that is hosted on IPFS. Hence no central authority can ever bring down this utility.  Commerce is enabled by ethereum smart contracts. Hence this platform is truly decentralized and censorship resistant.
