## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
A treasure hunt is set up which consists of a series of QR codes which must be scanned by users in the correct order. Each QR code has an associated picture stored on IPFS which shows its location, with the IPFS hash (and all user and tag data) stored on the blockchain. The fastest user to scan all the QR codes in the correct order wins. A leaderboard can be viewed showing the fastest times, and the status of players currently on the treasure hunt. The Dapp is hosted on a Quorum node on AWS.  This project is the basis for a supply chain item tracking Dapp which is in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.
