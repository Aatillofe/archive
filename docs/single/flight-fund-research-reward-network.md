# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Flight Fund provides network participants with access to a stable income and bounty opportunities for contributing to Sustainable Development Research. Integrating a streamlined business intelligence core, we are tracking team capital flows against daily grants and network donations.

Within the Flight Fund network, participants can develop impact assessment reports using the Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, validate impact research, and certify impact report. Goal-aligned reports are recorded as digital assets within a cooperative data trust allowing research contributors access to funding gained through incoming grants and network donations.


# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
The Research dApp is Drizzle React, written in Javascript on Node.js
The Business Intelligence Analytics Warehouse utilizes a Python 2.7 app hosted on Microsoft Azure.

The prototype and design work for a dApp target internal customers worked out on Sigma. This prototype provides a basis for the user story for research contributors. 

We have built a landing page for external customers on Squarespace at https://flight.fund where we will integrate Web3 iframes reporting on active contracts and business intelligence dashboards hosted on Google Sheets.
