# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
xDai on burner wallet has been a potential breakthrough for user adoption of crypto and has served eth Denver well.  However, friction for usage remains for both new and experienced users alike.  We aim to improve adoption by adding a simple burner.js for merchants to drop in as a DAI payment option for their websites and advance user experience with wallet UI tweaks, a Wyre ramp and a liquidity relayer for speed.  Many tradeoffs were considered to design an architecture to optimize for the most USD-native payments ecosystem in crypto today.
