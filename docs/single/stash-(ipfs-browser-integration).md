# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

IPFS Stash is a working chrome extension for easily **adding** and **managing** files on a local IPFS node (and therefore the IPFS network). We focused on the user experience first, imagining how a typical internet user might benefit from IPFS, without actually managing anything about the protocol. This project aims to help make the decentralized **ecosystem more accessible**, especially impacting **low internet connected** or **highly censored communities**.

.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

IPFS, React.js based Chrome Extension environment. The extension interfaces directly with a local (Siderus Orion) IPFS node, allowing seamless integration into all webpages (both web2 and web3).
