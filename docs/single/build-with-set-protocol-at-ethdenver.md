The Set Protocol team is excited to be sponsoring ETHDenver 2019, which will be our 
**sixth**
  
[ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.co/)
 event as attendees or sponsors. At ETHDenver last year, our team participated as hackers and built 
[Kitty Crates](https://devpost.com/software/kitty-crates)
 , a basket of CryptoKitties represented as an ERC-721!

Our overall amazing experience at ETHDenver 2018 led us to participate and sponsor many more of these events last year. We came away thoroughly impressed by the quality of projects that incorporated the 
[Set Developer Platform](https://docs.setprotocol.com/#/)
 , including:



 *  [Bündler](https://devpost.com/software/bundler-f03jdy) , the first functional Set issuance relayer built by the 0x team at ETHBerlin.

 *  [Primotif](https://devpost.com/software/primotif) , a multi- [DeFi](https://medium.com/set-protocol/announcing-defi-an-alliance-of-decentralized-finance-platforms-f9ac78c39fba) platform for buying and selling Sets of dYdX futures and Augur predictions using the 0x relayer built at ETHSF.

 *  [DepoSet](https://devpost.com/software/deposet) , an app that allows anyone to acquire Sets in one-click using Kyber Network liquidity built at ETHSingapore.
We want to build off the momentum of these past hackathons, and foster the continued growth of Set and maturation of the greater 
[DeFi](https://medium.com/set-protocol/announcing-defi-an-alliance-of-decentralized-finance-platforms-f9ac78c39fba)
 ecosystem. At ETHDenver, our 
[Set Protocol contracts](https://github.com/SetProtocol/set-protocol-contracts)
 will be live on MainNet for the first time and be available for anyone to build applications for real users!
To encourage everyone’s best work, we will be sponsoring several bounties for teams building on Set (more details to be announced soon). Make sure to take a look at our wish lists from 
[ETHSingapore](https://medium.com/set-protocol/build-with-set-protocol-at-eth-singapore-cedeec7a63b8)
 or 
[ETHSF](https://medium.com/set-protocol/build-with-set-protocol-at-ethsanfrancisco-49b740947b0e)
 to get started thinking.
