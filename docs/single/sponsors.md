Thanks for sponsoring ETHBerlin!

ETHBerlin is excited to have the amazing Gitcoin team providing a really easy way for you to contribute
to the main prize pool, or to sponsor projects that you find most promising.

### Overview
Gitcoin enables funding Github issues with any ERC20 token. It's as simple as pasting the Github issue into a form,
choosing a token, and once the work is done, you can payout the bounty with the click of a button. Furthermore, you can
contribute to existing bounties, and topping up the funds available to the issue. Checkout [this](https://gitcoin.co/funding/new)
quick explainer if you haven't funded an issue before.

### Main Prize Pool
There will be a main prize pool, which will be paid out to the overall winners (TODO: clarify). You can find
the issue [here]().

### Hosting Special Prizes
If you want to host special prizes, you can create your own issue in the hackathon's repository, describing the prize
and judging/acceptance criteria, and then fund it through Gitcoin. To get an idea how the issue will look like
you can either have a look at the issue for the main prize pool, or [issues](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyHackathon/issues/42) created for the colony hackathon
after which ETHBerlin's funding is modeled.
