## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
We added a feature to the Plasma Group plasma smart contract to transform it in to a general purpose, upgradeable plasma contract.  The plasma status quo has been to hardcode specific types of transaction formats as the core data processed by a plasma contract, and we stripped this out, thus allowing for a plug-and-play level of extensibility with anything ranging from smart contracts, state channels, augur integration, other plasma flavors, etc. In our demo, we implement a *Bitcoin* Lightning contract inside of our general purpose plasma contract.
