Today we want to share what we have been up to over the last month, the challenges we have met and 
**the progress we have made towards our first milestone: the Witnet prototype**
 .

## 💰 Fundraising
We’ve now 
**finalized the accounting of the WIT token pre-sale**
 . These are the figures:



 * 250M WIT tokens were pre-sold for $7,593,514.62

 * The price per token was $0.030374058
This gives us a healthy runway, enough to hit our next 
**milestones**
 :



 * Prototype: September 2018.

 * Testnet: January 2019

 * Mainnet Launch: Q4 2019
Also, during our sale we have agreed on 
**partnership with amazing teams**
 : Reflective Ventures, the RChain VC arm, who contributed $3M; Aragon and district0x.

## 💜 Team
During June 
[we’ve introduced you to Mario](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-mario-full-stack-engineer-and-scrum-master-e0d6f9e7c70c)
 , 
**a full-stack engineer and scrum master**
 who has joined our technical team to contribute to the development of the protocol.
We’ve also been lucky to have a 
**full-stack developer join our team**
 over the past weeks. You’ll get to know more about him soon through our 
[Team Insights](https://medium.com/witnet/tagged/team)
 .
 
**We still have** [open positions](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs)
 , so if you are aware of the impact a decentralized oracle network will have on the crypto landscape, be sure to check them out!

## 🔧 Product

### Sheikah prototype (Witnet desktop wallet app + smart contracts IDE)



 * The **app backend is close to done** , and we’ve been refactoring some ciritical parts to achieve rock solid stability and performance.

 *  **Work on the app UI has started** and is progressing at a brisk pace.

 * The **source code for our private key exchange format** ( [SatoshiLab’s SLIP-0032](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0032.md) ) has been isolated into a [separate open source library](https://github.com/witnet/ts-slip32) , which we have already [released on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slip32) .

 * Modesty aside, **code quality this far is top notch** . Every minute we spent improving our automated testing and QA setup is truly paying off!

### witnet-rust (Witnet full node implementation)



 * As Sheikah’s development is advancing well, we are starting to shift our focus towards **starting to accelerate the development of**  [witnet-rust](https://github.com/witnet/rust-witnet) .
