# Reading on Kauri

Reading articles on Kauri is straightforward, but here are a few features we hope make that experience better, and helps improve the reading experience for everyone.

## Browse content

Content on Kauri is organized into three groups that you can browse from the top menu of the site.

-   [Articles](https://kauri.io/articles) are the core content on Kauri, and every other group combines articles in some way.
-   [Collections](https://kauri.io/collections) are user-maintained groupings of their and other people's content.
-   [Communities](https://dev.kauri.io/communities) are articles and collections around a particular topic. The community owns anything posted into that community, and moderators of the community have extra permissions and admin powers in that community.

## Search

You can search titles and body text for articles using the search bar at the top of the screen.

On the top right of each article is an outline that helps you jump between sub-sections of an article.

## Find more to read

At the bottom of each article are two sections to help you find more great content to read.

First is the profile of the writer, click their icon to see all the content they've written.

Beneath this is a small selection of related content that we hope help you learn more about a given topic.

## Add to a collection or bookmark

Collections and bookmarked content help you group content you find interesting together. Collections are **public**, and bookmarked content is **private** to you.

You can add articles to your bookmarks or a collection by clicking the buttons under an article on any listings page, or at the top of any article page. You can also add articles to a collection from the collection edit screen.
