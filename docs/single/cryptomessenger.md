##Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Want an easy way to find out how your cryptocurrency portfolio is doing? Or how about really fast insights and an easy way to make purchases, all from your phone? CryptoMessenger now brings you a natural language Messenger bot that'll do all of this--try asking it how Bitcoin is doing today or telling it to buy Ethereum!

##Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
I'm using the Coincap API for getting historical and current prices and drawing insights from these and the ShapeShift API for making purchases straight from messenger. I'm also using Schmavery's Facebook chat API, and Dialogflow for NLP on the chat. The project was built with Node.js.
