## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

ETH Pages is a decentralized address book where a user can verifiably locate an Ethereum public key from a users Telegram handle or email address. Information on our platform cannot be tampered with and it will never go down because all social media handles and ethereum addresses are mapped on-chain. Off-chain verification nodes send emails that allows the user to verify authenticity and proof of ownership of social network ID’s. Ultimately, our service will streamline the user experience when sending Ethereum across the network because now you can verifiably locate a recipient.  Furthermore, this can be used as a reliable phonebook or censorship-resistant way for anyone to locate a Ethereum address.
