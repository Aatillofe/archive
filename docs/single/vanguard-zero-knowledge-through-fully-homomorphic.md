# Vanguard -- Zero Knowledge through Fully Homomorphic Encryption



Important: You MUST add a tag (at the top, under Title) for each bounty you'd like to submit to. Your project will not be considered for any bounties unless they are tagged. Click "ADD TAG", type  "bounty" and select the desired bounty from the list. If you'd like to apply to more than 6 bounties, please add the first 6 as tags, add the details for all of them (max of 10) here, and contact the Kauri team (info@kauri.io) to notify them of all 10 bounties you'd like to be considered for. These instructions can be deleted.

## Project Name
Vanguard


## Project Tagline/Description (140 Characters Max. Will be used on table card for judging)
Zero knowledge proofs through Fully Homomorphic Encryption


## Team Members. First and Last Names
John Pacific

## Status.im ID for Each Team Member (we will use this to contact you and your team)
0x04c1c78360f0013c89560ed5dffd42fa23ab9d6d7ab0b1466fc9d1650c6222f9d9ab107e1850a066f408ce28370ef7e04a201c8c5b9e9125192edc79e9f0fb0974

## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption, I create a generic framework that allows people to prove knowledge of a bytestring without revealing it to the other party, or having the other party know if the knowledge is correct. This is a solution of the Socialist Millionaire's problem where two millionaires would like to know if they have the same amount of money without revealing the amount to each other.

This framework is very simple, but it can be extended to generating zero knowledge proofs of entire programs and arbitrary functions with interesting applications in "Oblivious Consensus".

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Python, Redis, NuFHE


## Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)
Open


## All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
I'm only competing in the Open bounty
