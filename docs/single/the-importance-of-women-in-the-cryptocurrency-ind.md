As such a globally impactful field takes widespread coverage, 
**it is imperative to focus on the emphasis of the leaders and shapers of the industry,**
 who bring the sector to reach greater heights. In order to maintain this ongoing success in a long-term and sustainable manner, fostering and initiating processes 
**to integrate women into the crypto and blockchain field is vital**
 .
Societal tech implementation has taken full gear over the past decade, 
**overall linking to an increasingly substantial effort to incorporate the female sector to this movement**
 . Societal daily happenings are largely impacted by the shift of business and social engagement onto a technological foundation. Because of such a drastic transition, the importance of having women part of this adaptation has been perceived 
**as extremely crucial**
 . 
**Consequently, various initiatives have been catered to target this social importance.**
 
Over time, there is a clear rise of women specifically in the 
_tech_
 sector: 
**women hold 20% of tech jobs and 17.7% of startups have had a female founder**
 . This figure will undoubtedly escalate over time, as the persistent initiative to integrate women in the tech industry is acknowledged on a wider scale. However, the surprising figures of women’s affiliation in the 
_crypto-industry_
 are on a noticeable low. 
**Currently 5% of women are engaged in the crypto sector**
 ; such contributions include female developers, founders, and investors. 
**In contrast, when viewing the percentage of male community engagement in the crypto field, 95% is dominated by men**
 . This brings us to highlight the true state of exigency to change this current social standing.

**Being an active player in the crypto industry entails upholding certain virtues.**
 For, if one highly values the foundations that bolster the spread of cryptocurrency, it is not restricted within the framework of business.
> An active player in this domain attributes importance to individual freedoms, to the opportunity and possibilities of the individual.

A decentralized financial transaction system, such as that within the crypto, entails believing in the capabilities of the individual to contribute to a greater good and to the advancement of values that leave positive externalities on society and on productivity levels. Therefore, this is not limited to a business perspective, but rather the consideration of the various people who can play a key role in the decentralization of common business practice and reshape it in the most innovative nature. By understanding the value of innovation in crypto and the possibilities it opens to society, an individual who is well-versed in this sector understands the fact that this includes 
**the inclusion of women into this industry in order to maintain continuous development and exceptional success.**

Since the emergence of this industry and the commencement of its prevailing impact, 
**a number of women have been playing key roles in developing its global influence**
 . These women have been substantial contributors to the expansion of the field and explicitly demonstrate the fact that as the crypto field grows over time, women are 
_needed_
 to maintain the sustainable outcomes that will leave promising externalities on society. 
**Included in this article are ten such women who exemplify the true appreciable roles they have been playing into further progressing the scope of the blockchain sector.**
