## Company/Project Name and Description

**MakerDAO** is a decentralized organization dedicated to bringing stability to the crypto economy through Dai, the world's first stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is an asset-backed, hard currency that addresses the crypto economy’s problems of volatility with a secure and transparent smart contract platform of permission-less loans.

## Bounty 1 Overview: Improve the burner wallet!

**Description:** We love the https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet to pieces, but the story is just beginning. Make it even cooler.

Also, what do we have here? -> https://github.com/dbe/sign-in-with-burner

**Prize Amount:** 2,500 DAI - In the absence of a clear winner, the prize may be distributed between 2 or more teams.

## Bounty 2 Overview: Create a novel, Dai based lending platform. 

**Description:** It should be highly usable, mobile friendly, have a low barrier to entry and be broadly applicable to both developed and emerging economies. Try to find a niche that hasn’t already been filled.

**Prize Amount:** 2,000 DAI - In the absence of a clear winner, the prize may be distributed between 2 or more teams.

## Bounty 3 Overview: Advance the state of the art in zero-knowledge proofs. 

**Description:** Take a look at the work https://www.aztecprotocol.com/ is doing and see if you can fix some issues or come up with a usable tool that leverages their technology. Can you help optimize the gas fees?

**Prize Amount:** 2,000 DAI - In the absence of a clear winner, the prize may be distributed between 2 or more teams.

## Requirements (e.g., link to open source code)

Research and implement initiatives like universal logins, meta-transactions, recurring payments, gas relays, second layer solutions, or any anything else that can help increase Dai adoption.

## Judging Criteria

Be amazing.

## Additional Information
**Grants Program:** As an added bonus, all winners of our challenges who apply to the [MakerDAO Community Fund](https://medium.com/makerdao/announcing-the-makerdao-core-community-development-initiative-d388bfba88e3) will have their applications fast-tracked through the process.
