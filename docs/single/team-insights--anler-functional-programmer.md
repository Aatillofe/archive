### Hi Anler! Welcome to the team, it‚Äôs awesome to have you! Could you start by telling us a bit about you and your background?
Hi there! My name is Anler and I‚Äôm from Cuba. I learned to program quite late, at the age of 19 when I started university. The languages I used then were C and C++ since I was studying Automation Engineering. I dropped out of university in order to emigrate to Spain where my dad lived. Once in Spain, I immediately was 
**fascinated by the Internet and the amount of information you have at the tips of your fingers**
 , and since that moment 
**I have dedicated my time to learn and teach anything that catches my attention**
 , which is quite a lot.
One of my passions is to teach what I‚Äôve learnt, so 
**I have been a teacher at** [IronHack](http://ironhack.com)**,** I‚Äôm also working together with [FunctionalHub](https://functionalhub.thinkific.com/) on a series of courses about functional programming and **I co-created the**[Madrid Haskell Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Haskell-MAD/)**to spread out my love for functional programming** and Haskell in particular.

### How did you end up deciding to work in the crypto space?
I just find the whole topic quite attractive and interesting. I think of myself as a frustrated mathematician so that makes 
**cryptography a wonderful space**
 where I can enjoy 
**learning and applying concepts that are deeply-linked to math**
 .
Having the opportunity to know what‚Äôs exactly happening in the c 
**rypto space and how that‚Äòs going to shape our future is also priceless**
 for me. Some friends from the Haskell community have created the Blockchain Madrid Haskell Users Group to help others understand the new opportunities and applications that this technology offers.

### As an experienced developer, what kind of tools do you use and what makes them appropriate for your work?
As a software developer I really don‚Äôt need much, just a 
**POSIX system and Emacs**
 , among the required ones I need for a particular problem using a particular technology.
 
**The most important thing for me when working on something is the ability to find documentation quickly**
 , that‚Äôs why I love Emacs and it‚Äôs self-documenting system. I think tools should guide you in how to use them by giving you 
**meaningful error messages and pointing you to the docs**
 when you accidentally use them incorrectly. I think my ideal tool would be a Lisp Machine; I hope some day it comes back to life.

### Witnet uses Rust as its back end development language. What makes it suitable for the project and what are your favorite parts about it?
 
**Rust is an amazing language**
 . It gives you the control you need when creating critical/high-performance software, and it does so 
**without forcing you to juggle with safety**
 . Carrying the burden of making critical software memory safe is something I do not enjoy at all; 
**I prefer to feed my brain other creative tasks**
 rather than thinking of where I screwed up by freeing the wrong pointer. That‚Äôs what machines are for, in my opinion.
For Witnet, it is an 
**obvious choice since it addresses our two main concerns: performance and safety**
 .

### There are some great projects working on inspiring missions. What attracted you to Witnet and what would you say is the potential of the project?
Being a 
**young project founded by smart people with a big challenge**
 was the main thing that attracted me to Witnet. I love to learn from others, as well as to work in a family-like environment.
Witnet gives me that along with the 
**opportunity of creating a tool that can help anyone (hopefully everyone)**
 to feed smart contracts verified information that could not be tampered by any entity.

### To wrap up, what are some things that you like to do outside of your work life?
I enjoy to 
**exercise, travel, learn, feed the cats that live in my neighborhood,**
 and specially now, the thing I enjoy the most, is to 
**stroll with my newborn baby around the city**
 .
