#### Importing your documentation to Kauri
Link to the tool: [https://import.beta.kauri.io](https://import.beta.kauri.io)  
Link to the beta: [https://beta.kauri.io](https://beta.kauri.io)

    * (1) Medium user profile (e.g. 'https://medium.com/@kauri_io')
    * (2) Medium publication (e.g. 'https://blog.kauri.io')
    * (3) Single Medium article (e.g. 'https://media.consensys.net/the-forgotten-side-of-decentralization-f713aaa8c8b4')

* __Step 3__: select which articles you would like to import to draft on Kauri, and click 'IMPORT'
    * the selected articles will then be imported, and once complete, can be viewed in Kauri in the 'Draft' section of the 'Manage' tab of your Kauri profile. The importer will redirect you to your profile once complete.

* __Step 4__: we highly suggest reviewing your imported draft articles via Kauri's 'preview' feature to ensure the article's HTML to Markdown conversion was completed successfully

* __To publish__, once you've previewed your content and ensured the formatting is correct, simply click 'PUBLISH ARTICLE' located in the top right of the page

#### Things to be aware of

* The tool will import tweets and embedded youtube videos; if you use another video hosting service, such as vimeo, please update the links to your embedded videos in the Kauri editor when the article is in draft stage
* Importing a large amount of articles can take up to 15-20 minutes
