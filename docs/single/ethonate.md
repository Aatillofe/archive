## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Ethonate is a app that allows anybody to create a profile on the internet to share and easily receive donations using Ethereum. Users can create a minimalistic profile with an easy to use form that shows just enough to learn about who you’re donating to. Our focus was on a clean and simple to understand user experience instead of cluttering the UI with all kinds of information so that it could be as approachable as possible. We currently support donating with MyCrypto.
