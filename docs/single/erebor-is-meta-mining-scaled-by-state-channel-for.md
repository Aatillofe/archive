## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
_Built with our open-sourced SDK, we demonstrated our PoC implementation of peer-to-peer state channel that help scale Ethereum. Through meta mining, it not only bootstrap our multi-purpose p2p channels, but also help incentivize node operation. And it's fun!_

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
_geth (les2) + ipfs (merkle data store) + libp2p pubsub + RLPx (packet encode) + electron + react + nodejs + 11BE SDK_
