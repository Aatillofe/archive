# ETH San Francisco Winner Roundup


Another month, another awesome ETH Global hackathon; this time in the capital of tech, San Francisco.  On October 5th, over 1000 hackers congregated on the 100 year old Palace of Fine Arts, where they could listen to high quality talks and dicussions from the likes of Vitalik Buterin and Kevin Owocki whilst building cutting edge decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform.

The winning DApps from this leg were as varied and interesting as ever, with many utilising libraries and products developed by sponsoring projects.

In no particular order, the 10 finalists were:

## Augur Pro

> Betting odds for Augur Markets on iOS

The Augur Pro team created an iOS application that taps into augur markets, but displays them more like a traditional gambling and sports betting website, rather than a trading UI that most current Augur UIs tend to mimic.

## Kora

> A governance tool creating structured guidelines around stakeholder discourse in a decision-making process

The Kora team have built a set of tools that help facilitate distributed decision making in practice, rather than just in theory.  Features include stakeholder identification,  parameter personalisation, governance token distribution and template generation.

## CryptoPay

> Anytoken, Anywhere with DAI

The CryptoPay members believe that there is still a lot to be done before blockchain technology goes mainstream, and have therefore created their application to allow anyone to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.  They have developed a smart contract that can automatically swap any ERC20 token to DAI and ETH, utilising the Kyber Network on-chain liquidity.

## SplitterConverter

> Deploy a contract that you can send ETH or DAI to. When users withdraw, the funds are converted and split as desired

A frontend that lets you deploy a smart contract that can split all funds held within it (ETH or DAI) to multiple receivers based on a configured percentage share.  Each receiver can choose to receive either ETH or DAI, and the Kyber Network is used for on-chain conversion.

## Gifty

> Send NFTs via SMS

Gifty makes gifting crypto assets to friends easier by allowing Non-Fungible Tokens to be sent via SMS.  This is enabled via the `gifty://` url scheme; which can be opened by the receiver in order to deep-link the NFT into the users wallet application.

## Harberger Ads

> Purchase advertisement space using a Harberger tax ownership model

The concept of Harberger taxes have become more popular recently, somewhat due to the ‘Radical Markets’ book, authored by Glen Weyl and Eric Posner.  The Harberger Ads team built an ad serving platform that prices ad space using Harberger Taxes.  Ad space is self-valued, and taxes are paid at this valuation; but the ad space can be instantly purchased by someone else if they believe that the ad space is worth more.

## Atomic XShard Transactions with Routing / Balancing PoC

> EVM sharding

Following on from the work done at ETH Berlin, Vlad Zamfir and friends continued to built additional functionality into their EVM sharding proof of concept.  Current features include cross-shard message routing, topology rebalancing and improved visualization.

## Safu

> A rolodex and key manager for all your crypto accounts

The safe team members all agreed that keeping track of their crypto addresses was a common problem, and so they decided to build an easy-to-use browser extension to help!  Safu lets you keep track of your cryptocurrency accounts in the browser by allowing you to check balances, get quick links and QR codes, and securely store your keys.

## Sendput

> Get paid now for outstanding reimbursements

The Sendput team built an MVP that utilising Bloom and Dharma in order to issue micro-loads for individuals so that they don’t have to wait for a company to reimburse them.

[Github](https://github.com/colark/sendput)

## SayToshi

> Ethereum’s decentralized social media manager

SayToshi provides a way for crypto influencers to make money by essentially allowing people to send a tweet from their twitter account.  This works by TWEETH token holders voting on tweets proposed by the public, in a system similar to a token-curated registry.  Tweets that are accepted, get added to a queue ready to be published, with funds staked by the losing voters being distributed to the account holder and successful voters.
