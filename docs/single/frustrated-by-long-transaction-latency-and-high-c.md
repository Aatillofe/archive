Celer Network is a leading layer 2 scaling platform that enables fast, easy and secure off-chain transactions for not only payment transactions, but also generalized off-chain smart contract. It enables everyone to quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable decentralized applications through innovations in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics.

# What can you build on Celer?
Our cWallet application with a connect-five board game and instant payment is entirely built based on Celer SDK and you can also build your game on Celer as well!!

During the past hackathon, we have multiple exciting dApps built on top, some examples are:


*  [Off-chain Prediction Market](https://devpost.com/software/airprediction)

*  [Micro Services with SLA Guarantee](https://devpost.com/software/micro-subscription)

*  [Better IDE UX for Developing on Celer Network](https://devpost.com/software/sce-601wav)

*  [Financial Derivative Trading Market with Instant Order Matching](https://devpost.com/software/slick-gas-option)

*  [Interactive Game on Celer](https://devpost.com/software/shakieshakie)

# How to build on Celer?
Celer Network’s off-chain SDK is the
**First and Only**
tool in the current market which uses generalized state channel to implement its off-chain scalability. Take pride in being one of pioneer developers that adopt this revolutionary tech stack by building dApps on top of Celer!
**Our core engineers will walk you through the development process to help you BUIDL at the event!**

# Where to find Celer Network @ ETHDenver?

We'll be hosting a meetup with the Chainlink team the night before the hackathon, on Thursday February 14th, a perfect prelude to your Valentine's Day evening! Learn more about the meetup and [RSVP](http://bit.ly/denvermeetup) here.

Celer Network’s core engineers with Cnicorn T-shirts will present onsite to give instructions and answer questions at our booth @ETHDenver. You’re welcomed to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Trhab5w) and [Telegram](https://t.me/celernetwork) channel beforehand!

To achieve the level of interaction engaging a larger number of users, simply tweaking the blockchain layer is not enough.
**A layer-2 scalability platform that enables hyper-interactive applications is a must.**
