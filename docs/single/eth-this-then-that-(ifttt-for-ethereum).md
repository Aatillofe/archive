## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
If This Then That for Ethereum! The world computer (aka mainnet) is now home to many different dapps and financial primitives (DAI, CDPs, dydx), but it usually takes a coder to combine them into something new and innovative. Not anymore! Using Eth This Then That, anyone can combine these building blocks without writing a line of code! Get notified if there's a large transfer of your favorite token! Automatically top off your CDP before it gets liquidated! Monitor various exchange rates and lend out your crypto for the best return! The possibilities are endless! Developers are welcome to contribute new "triggers" or "actions".
