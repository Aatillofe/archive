Dear Kauri users, 

TL;DR We're working on some new features and need your help! Please fill in the following 5 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/fP31aR29ab9Qgnvx6) and come speak with us on [discord](https://discord.gg/9mF8qnB).

As you're well aware, at Kauri we've been working hard building the platform for the past year and thank our users for the strong engagement within the blockchain space. Writers and community members have published around 700 articles covering many previous knowledge gaps, and you keep on tackling new knowledge areas. 

More recently, we added communities to help projects or research areas attract more contributors to build and organize a collaborative knowledge base around their topic.

The aim of the survey is to help us to frame the next phase of our platform and potential generalized protocol features. We will also release the results of this survey back to the community. 

Best,
Andreas
