## Detailed Project Description
Gran Fondo is a competitive commitment device. It encourages athletes who use Strava, a social fitness tracking platform, to create fitness challenges, stake ETH as an incentive to meet their goals, and then compete for the ETH prizes. The app makes it simple to create or join a fitness challenge, view competitors, and claim your rewards if, and only if, the Strava API proves that you  have earned them. The Chainlink integration enables us to pass data between the Strava API and our smart contract holding staked funds.

## All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
Chainlink: we integrated the Chainlink contract to query the Strava Fitness service and verify whether an athlete has completed a specific segment challenge fast enough and before the deadline. Chainlink sends the result of this query to our smart contract.


Important: You MUST add a tag (at the top, under Title) for each bounty you'd like to submit to. Your project will not be considered for any bounties unless they are tagged. Click "ADD TAG", type  "bounty" and select the desired bounty from the list. If you'd like to apply to more than 6 bounties, please add the first 6 as tags, add the details for all of them (max of 10) here, and contact the Kauri team (info@kauri.io) to notify them of all 10 bounties you'd like to be considered for. These instructions can be deleted.
