## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Spin.fm is decentralized p2p social app that allows you to anonymously or privately create music rooms. You're either a cute avatar bobbing your head or a badass DJ rocking the stage. Create your own unique ERC21 avatar or tip your favorite DJ in ETH. Music is share in real-time, jump at any time perfectly in sync with everyone in the room - the music streamed in chunks and dynamically removed as you listen - avoiding any legal issues.
