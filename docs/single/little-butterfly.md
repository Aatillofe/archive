## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

- Small crypto-collectible game about butterflies, flowers, and hearts -- or, about the ephemerality of experiences and the memories they leave behind
- Implements ERC721 tokens with computed state that evolves over time, without requiring smart contract calls
- Proof-of-concept responsive web design + mobile authentication support with Fortmatic on browsers without dapp support -- relying on MetaMask where available, or Infura for read-only access otherwise.
