# What are Dapps? (An ultimate guide)

![](https://api.kauri.io:443/ipfs/QmeZPLRQgBL58Bs33zx9hyk8Gdx5YQR2hbcfg7sHu4d92J)

If you have been following blockchain space for a while, you must have come across the word Dapps. but what are Dapps?

**Dapps stands for Decentralized Applications**. They have been around since the launch of [Ethereum](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/ethereum/) and [Smart Contracts](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/smart-contact/).

Dapps are very different from a classical web app. For instance, a web app runs on a centralized server, and whenever a client requests for information, it receives the requested information from the server. In addition, a centralized authority controls a web app, and if the server goes down, the web app will come to a halt. 

Web apps are more prone to cyber-attacks. However, on the other hand, Dapps function in a decentralized environment.

Some of the Dapps characteristics are –

*   **Decentralized **that makes them independent, and no one controls them.
*   **Deterministic** i.e., they perform the same function irrespective of the environment they are executed.
*   **Turing compatible**, which means given the required resources, the Dapps can perform any action.
*   **Isolated**, which means they are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the [smart contract](https://blog.coincodecap.com/tag/smart-contact/) happens to have a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

Innovation in Dapp has led to the development of many tools that are making cryptocurrency experience and enjoyable and secure. Some of the field where Dapps have more profound impacts are-

### **Wallet**

Dapp wallets (Or [Smart contract wallets](https://blog.coincodecap.com/best-smart-contract-wallet/)) have been gaining popularity. They provide various functionality besides storing your private key. These wallets are versatile and secure thanks to the flexibility and innovation in designing smart contracts.
