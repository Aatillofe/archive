# Witnet Monthly Report — May 2018



Today we want to share what we have been up to over the last month, the challenges we have met and 
**the progress we have made towards our first milestone: the Witnet prototype**.

### 💰 Fundraising
After the public sale we run in March on 
[Republic Crypto](https://republic.co/witnet)
 , we have now closed also the private sale we run during April and May. We are still finalizing the accounting process but 
**we are happy to announce that we have secured ~$7.5 million in capital.**
 We should have the final, exact figure in the next few days. This great amount of funding will help us achieve our mission. 
**A big thank you to all those who participated!**
 

### 💜 Team
This month we’ve 
**interviewed** [María](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-mar%C3%ADa-back-end-engineer-27fef70af1d1) **and** [Anler](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-anler-back-end-engineer-and-functional-programmer-eca357baef47)**, our two latest additions to the team.** They’re two very talented back end engineers with really interesting careers so far. Make sure you check out their interviews! We’ve also **welcomed a scrum master and a front end developer into our team.** You’ll get to know them very soon through our [Team Insights](https://medium.com/witnet/tagged/team).

**We still have** [open positions](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs)
 , so if you are aware of the impact a decentralized oracle network will have on the crypto landscape, be sure to check them out!

### 🔧 Product
As you may know, 
**Sheikah is Witnet’s first desktop client.**
 It will serve both as a wallet for the native Wit token and as an IDE for Witnet’s smart contracts and RAD requests.
We are releasing a Sheikah prototype as soon as possible (likely, July). It won’t be completely functional but at least 
**it will let you create your own wallets and addresses and give you a glimpse on how everything will work**
 when we release our testnet.
These have been this month’s main development items regarding the Sheikah prototype:



 *  **Encrypted storage support** was added for securily storing your Witnet private keys.

 * The **backend side of creating mnemonics, seeds, private keys and addresses** is close to ready. [Johann](https://github.com/kronolynx) and [Anler](https://github.com/anler) are taking care of this.

 * The **IPC API for reliable real time communication and synchronization between the frontend and backend** is also on its way thanks to [María](https://github.com/mmartinbar) .

 * We have also been working on **designing the Sheikah interface** . We’ll be able to show the sketches soon.

**Anyone can follow our progress** [on the project’s Github repo](https://github.com/witnet/sheikah) **, as well as contribute.** We’re eager to engage with the developer community around the development of the Sheikah prototype. Pretty cool stuff, you’ll see!

That’s what we’ve been working on over the last month! Please let us know what you think of the recent developments by 
**sharing your thoughts**
 with the team.
