## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
95% of open source repos rely on a single maintainer, putting them at great risk. Our project provides a method for outsourcing management to the community using a decentralized voting system. DAO Gitbot is a simple Github plugin which utilizes a single smart contract to approve pull requests upon a positive response from the community.
