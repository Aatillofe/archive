## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
We built a native xDai-based lending platform with user-friendly wallet, cross-application coordination (via deep links) to provide p2p micro-loans to users willing to buy goods in various marketplaces with borrowed xDai or lend xDai to their peers earning interest on the deposit of funds on our platform. Our model use case: if I have spent all my buffiDai coins on food already but still hungry, it allows me to borrow 10 buffiDai coins from another ETH Denver participant, who still has them, and return it as 11 buffiDai coins exactly one year later on ETH Denver 2020.
