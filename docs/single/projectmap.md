## Details
Many areas of the world are under-mapped and even in developed countries, disasters will cause meaningful topological changes to road networks, structures, and utilities. In 2018 alone, natural disasters caused $160B in damage and killed over ten thousand people.

We propose a novel and extensible framework we feel is superior to the standard bounty. We utilize a split reward pool whereby users receive instant payout on verified map edits but also *continue* to receive royalty payments for the life of those edits. This is a natural gamification whereby high demand edits will be rewarded.

Our royalty contract can incentivize rapid response by enabling a time decay feature. It also provides mechanisms for the reward recipients to reinvest or donate funds back into the pool or to other humanitarian projects.

##Tech Stack (Protocols, languages, APIs, etc)

- User on-boarding: Portis, Blocknative
- Front-end: React, Typescript
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity
