## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

Shares seeks to demystify the stock issuance process for startups by facilitating the creation and issuance of uncertificated shares in the form of ERC-20 tokens.  You don't need paper certificates, a spreadsheet, or a lawyer.  Just 5 minutes and a wallet address!

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

We use IPFS for hosting the dApp portion of Shares, which is responsible for creating an ERC-721 token (one per company) that represents ownership of their domain on DwNS (Decentralized Web Naming System) and provides an easy to remember URL (ex. acme.shares.dwns.io).  Uncertificated shares are subsequently minted through an ERC-20 contract and are sent to a user designated Ethereum address.  The view layer for the dApp is was made using VueJS. For the web app portion, we used NodeJS + Express and connected to the Twilio and Meerkat APIs (Meerkat is *not* currently demoable, we are working off of local chain, currently).
