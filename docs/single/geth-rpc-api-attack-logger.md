# Geth RPC-API Attack Logger



## Project Name
Geth RPC-API Attack Logger (graal?)

## Project Tagline/Description (140 Characters Max. Will be used on table card for judging)
An Ethereum RPC-API medium-interaction honeypot for gathering attack information.

## Team Members.

## Status.im ID
* `Right Uniform Grayling` https://get.status.im/user/0x04fb2e877483e93d1b3cbb55db5e1dc67baf0f47f4b7226fa51d48c408dc101204714345d9a2fc381f7ae48e8c775a94a0ac5985b374e6f02a24152645f819f140 (Todd)

## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

At some point many of us have left an RPC-API port open, perhaps by accident, or just out of curiosity. This is a project to assist in gathering data around what attacks take place when that happens, including the IP addresses involved, and the destination addresses the attackers use. 

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, APIâ€™s, etc.)

* Docker is used to start a geth light client, and a custom proxy.
* The proxy is a simple golang service that provides logging, uses a kvs (bboltdb) to keep a running count of request types, and rewrites a few API calls that attackers find enticing, such as having an unlocked wallet. 
* The logs are intended to be ingested into elasticsearch for more analysis.
* A simple stats.json file is created by the proxy, with the intent that this could be pushed into s3. This json file drives a (very simple) vue2 dashboard to show information about what IP addresses, what RPC methods, or the destination addresses for attempted outgoing transfers.

## Track: Open
