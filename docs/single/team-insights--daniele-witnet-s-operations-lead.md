#### Hi Daniele! I‚Äôm eager to do this interview after some weeks working together at Witnet. Let‚Äôs talk a bit about your background so the community can get to know you better.
 
**I‚Äôve always been passionate about technology in general and about the internet in particular**
 . I remember when my father brought home a modem when I was 13, in 1994, and 
**my life changed forever**
 . Since then, I‚Äôve been really fascinated about both the hacker culture and the cypherpunk scene. In my teens I used to spend countless hours chatting on IRC and lurking in Usenet newsgroups. I loved to tinker with 
**public key cryptography**
 ‚Äî it was something truly fascinating for me. Not because I had anything secret or that I didn‚Äôt want to share, but because I felt that through cryptography individuals had the possibility to 
**claim radical ownership of their personal space**
 , reducing the coercive power others have over them.
I‚Äôve also been 
**building companies**
 since I was quite young. I failed most of the times, but I succeeded enough to keep trying. Finally, in 2016 I started doing my own 
[investing in startups](https://angel.co/daniele-levi)
 .

#### From that perspective, what did you find most attractive about the crypto space in the first place?
As you might imagine, when I first read about 
**Bitcoin**
 in late 2012, everything made sense to me. I felt I was witnessing the initial moments of an 
**historical revolution, one that I had to live in the frontline**
 . Since then, I‚Äôve dedicated 100% of my time to Bitcoin first, and other related technologies later. In this space I‚Äôve done a few things. I ran a mining operation in 2012 and 2013, then I tried (and failed) to create an exchange in early 2013. 
**In 2014 I co-founded** [Stampery](https://stampery.com/)
 .

#### For people who might not know the details, what‚Äôs Witnet and why is this technology relevant?
 
[Witnet](http://witnet.io) **is a decentralized oracle network: a fundamental piece of infrastructure for the future, decentralized internet**
 . Smart contracts are very exciting technology, but they‚Äôre missing something crucial: 
**the ability to retrieve information from external data sources in a decentralized way**
 . Right now, smart contracts are either self-referential or they rely on centralized systems for retrieving data. This at best limits their utility, and at worst introduces dangerous points of failure that by themselves invalidate the 
**core value proposals of smart contracts**
 .
If we want to deliver on the promise of smart contracts, on top of having a decentralized execution environment we need to be able to 
**feed them information in a trustless way**
 . That‚Äôs what Witnet is for.

#### What are the next steps in Witnet‚Äôs roadmap you‚Äôre most excited about?
On the short term, I‚Äôm very excited about 
**building and growing the team**
 . The feedback from the community is great and there‚Äôs a lot of incredible talent willing to help us to solve the oracle problem. I‚Äôm also very driven by the sight of the 
**prototype we‚Äôre launching very soon**
 . On the longer term, my dream is 
**to see Witnet empowering smart contract developers all over the world**
 .

#### The crypto ecosystem is flooded with talent. What are some of your favourite projects?
I will start with my first love in the crypto space: 
**Bitcoin**
 . To me, It is 
**the best hedge against the failure of the traditional financial system**
 . I see it as an insurance against a dystopic future. Also, as a long term store of value, Bitcoin has no rivals. If you understand that being a decentralized, digital store of value is its main role you also understand that the fact that it is very difficult to change is not a bug, but a feature. Having a reliable digital store of value that is censorship resistant, easy to transfer and transport, and very difficult to seize is 
**radically empowering for people**
 .

I‚Äôm also greatly into 
**Ethereum**
 . While Bitcoin gives people the opportunity to really take ownership of their money (in a radical way), Ethereum 
**redefines how people do business with each other**
 . A new kind of relationship is possible in which corruption, coercion and extortion are taken out of the equation. That‚Äôs exciting.

Other projects I like: 
**Lighting Network**
 . I love this approach for scaling bitcoin. We will see if it works as designed, but in any case it‚Äôs going to be really interesting to watch. I also like a lot what 
[Aragon](http://aragon.one) and [District0x](https://district0x.io/) are doing in their fields of work. Another innovation that fascinates me quite a lot is 
**Non Fungible Tokens**
 . The concept of digital, decentralized scarcity will create completely new businesses and creative models we cannot even imagine today.

#### To wrap up, tell us about some things that you like to spend your free time doing! What are your hobbies?
 
**I really enjoy music**
 . I was a professional DJ for some years, and I still dj as an amateur today. I buy vinyl records compulsively. Usually not two weeks go by without me receiving some at home or at the office. I have a collection of 
**thousands of electronic music vinyls**
 ‚Äî especially underground Chicago house and Detroit techno, but also electro or ambient. 
**I also love travelling, reading, enjoying good food, playing chess and spending time with my family**
 .

#### Thank you for your time, Daniele! /üëÅ/
