## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

CryptoFlash let's users transfer ETH via a meta transaction service layer. This means users sending and receiving transfers do not need to deal with the overhead of paying gas fees, but can still receive, hold, and send ETH. Primary method of transfer is via a shared URL - something that non-crypto users are familiar with. All balances are held in contracts (not keys) that users have multi-device access to via universal-login pattern. CryptoFlash uses the new constantinople feature CREATE2.
