# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

Global Trade System is, well, a global system for trading anything you can tokenize, ranging from virtual assets in video games and streetwear clothes to real money, in a safe way without any risk of being scammed or getting counterfeit products. The fundamental value in our project is decentralizing trust - we assume that if people want to have something, they already trust the company who made it, that is why our trust model is based exactly on that relation. On our platform, everyone can become a "trusted" third party (although we prefer manufacturers, or REALLY widely known and trusted people from the community), who (for example: for a small fee) emit tokens for the goods they store. It's essentially a middlemen system widely known to gaming community, but for every other industry, combined.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

Our platform is powered by a smart contract deployed on Ethereum and written obviously in Solidity using Truffle. End user can interact with it via our web interface, written in Javascript using React.
