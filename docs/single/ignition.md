## Inspiration
_“3 hackers and a finance bro walked into a bar”_

The driving idea behind project Ignition is to help get smart money into the hands of capable and clever developers. 
The industry is changing quickly; The technology is sprinting full steam ahead, with improvements to the infrastructure happening every and the community is expanding, with more devs and specifically more hackathons than ever before. 
At the same time, the investor base is changing. Existing crypto funds have been burned by the recent crash in prices and traditional investment verticals are starting are starting to show signs of appetite.
It’s a not an easy time to match funds with promising projects, but maybe we can make it a bit easier.


## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

Ignition aims to increase the credibility of hackathon results by transacting key elements of the process on-chain. Hackathon wins accrue credibility through verified judge identity, award amounts and the pool of hackers, anchored by material transaction flows (award/bounty payments). 
That improved credibility opens the door for easier fundraising for hackathon winners, and better investment choices for investors (particularly those without existing connections to the crypto community)
