## Project Description

No one is good enough to consistently buy the dip/sell the peak when buying/selling crypto.  Your best strategy to avoid making a move at the wrong time is to spread your moves out so it is less likely to mistime the market.  As a side-effect I found out just how quick on-boarding with Wyre is -- only *4* steps to go from zero to purchasing on their exchange.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

* Serverless AWS  node.js lamda functions for communicating with Wyre's APIs
* React Frontend

## Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)

## A link to all your source code on a public repo (i.e. Github)
