## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
In order for blockchain to go main stream, we need to build a general purpose tool, that will offer three key features: utility, cost, security/data privacy. ETHBook is that tool, costing less than $150, having web3 ready to go, but without invasive Google apps. It will allow the general population to benefit from the features it offers and understand the technology by using it day to day. Google Drive is now IPFS, Google Chrome is now brave, open source everything.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
