## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
In order to bring Plasma closer to being used in real-world situations, we've built the first Watchtower proof-of-concept. A Watchtower's goal is help its users avoid losing their funds from invalid exits of a Plasma chain. Due to the centralization of
Plasma operators, it is critical that their actions be monitored closely. Our project is the first step towards completely automating the complex process of challenging invalid exits and performing exits if the Plasma chain is compromised.
