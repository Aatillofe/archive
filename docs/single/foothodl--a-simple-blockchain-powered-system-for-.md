## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

Stablecoins, xDai and burner wallets all make it easier to pay with cryptocurrency. But for people in need, these solutions are still not sufficient for solving for immediate necessities such as food. Foothodl (www.foothodl.com) is recruiting a distributed network of volunteers who can use a simple modified burner wallet app to assist people in need, who only themselves need to be able to receive a text message confirmation code when being assisted. 
Foothodl is very simple, but by being built with xDai and the Ethereum blockchain, it creates more transparency and opens up the possibility for governance, credit systems, etc. to leverage the usability improvement that FootHodl provides. 

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

xDai network. Modified version of Austin Griffith's Burner Wallet. Javascript/Node, Python/Flask, Google Cloud. Twilio.  Solidity and web3.js.
