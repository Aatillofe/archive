## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Combining the governance model of Colony and the ideals of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we created a TruffleBox that teaches developers how to be both humanitarians and coders. The dapp is a developer starter kit that shows how to harness the project management capabilities of Colony to incentivize, organize, and govern the work needed to tackle the UNSDGs. The project exists as a Github repo run in a local environment and is pending submission to Truffle so developers can easily get started.
