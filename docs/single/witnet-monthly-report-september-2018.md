 _For a some quick bites of information about Witnet and oracles in general, please_  [read this 3 minute primer](https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-smart-contracts-with-real-power-f79e326da3a4) , [take a look at our whitepaper](https://witnet.io/static/witnet-whitepaper.pdf)  _, or check out our_  [project‚Äôs ‚Äúmust-reads‚Äù digest](https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-must-reads-digest-b8d26a909efb)_._ 

Greetings, Witnet community! As planned, every month we update you on our work towards the milestones [set in our project roadmap](https://republic.co/witnet). Last month, we proudly shared [the release of our prototype, Sheikah](https://medium.com/witnet/welcome-to-sheikah-5b658d4815c8). Today we will share what we have been up to since then and **the progress we have made towards our next milestone: the Witnet testnet**.

### üîß Product
Over the last few weeks, we have been discussing and defining the architecture for [Witnet-rust](https://github.com/witnet/witnet-rust) , the first open source implementation of the Witnet Decentralized Oracle Network protocol.

For the sake of transparency of this process, we will be publishing all the engineering decisions on our new official documentation at [docs.witnet.io](http://docs.witnet.io/) (a work in progress!)

Development of `Witnet-rust` has already been kick-started, and many important components are ongoing intensive development. We are pleased to share that some components are even ready to be merged into the `master` master branch (e.g. the storage engine for persisting the blockchain).

**Summing up,** things are moving crazy fast over here. We are still on track for an early 2019 testnet release. You‚Äôd better get ready!

#### By The Way‚Ä¶ Open Source Contributors:
Are you interested in contributing to the development of `Witnet-rust` ? We would be thrilled to have you! Visit our new contributing guide for more info: ( [https://docs.witnet.io/contributing/](https://docs.witnet.io/contributing/) )

### üíú Community
October is shaping up to be an epic month for the blockchain community and Witnet will be speaking at, sponsoring and attending a variety of conferences and hackathons in the coming weeks. We are looking forward to being part of the many exciting conversations happening around the rapid innovation and development in our space. Below are events we are confirmed to be a part of. If you‚Äôd like to connect with us while we‚Äôre there, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out and let us know!

### üé® Content
Since we started this journey towards solving the oracle problem, we‚Äôve produced a number of posts focusing on explaining different aspects of the project to our community. We‚Äôve compiled these in a post, [Witnet Must-Reads Digest](https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-must-reads-digest-b8d26a909efb) , which will be updated on an ongoing basis as we keep coming up with content. It is currently divided in the following sections:

 * Data Oracle Basics

 * The Why‚Äôs

 * Initial Usecases

 * Technology

 * Exploration

The first post we‚Äôve included in the Exploration section is [On Oracles and Schelling Points](https://medium.com/witnet/on-oracles-and-schelling-points-2a1807c29b73), a deep dive into how finding consensus through Schelling schemes works. Witnet nodes agree on the veracity of a data point through this type of consensus, so it‚Äôs a valuable read if you want to fully understand how the Decentralized Oracle Network protocol works.

That‚Äôs a quick update on what we‚Äôve been working on over the last weeks! As always, **we want to remind you that the Witnet Foundation still has**  [open positions](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs) , so if you are aware of the impact a Decentralized Oracle Network will have on the crypto landscape and want to get involved, be sure to check them out.

Please let us know what you think of the recent developments by **sharing your thoughts** with the team in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QKEa5gU) chat or on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/witnet).
