We’re always there to be the bridge between fiat & crypto so that the target market is not just crypto, but anyone who’s got an internet connection. Lowering the barriers to entry is our focus because accelerating the product feedback loop will hackers iterate more quickly.

### Hackathon Ideas
It’s always helpful to get the brain juices flowing. With the amount of opportunity in front of you all, it’s easy to get decision paralysis and not even know where to begin. Below are a few ideas that could be great long-term for the community!

#### 👑🌽 Trustless BTC-20 👑🌽



 *  **Problem:**  _Bitcoin serves as over 60% of the daily liquidity traded on crypto exchanges. Trusted setups lead to this asset being minted and usable on the Ethereum network, but little incentive from the supply side._ 
1:1 peg of Bitcoin and an ERC-20 Bitcoin. Just like the 1:1 peg of fiat backed stablecoins, but it’s Bitcoin.
ERC-20 is table stakes for most exchanges around the world.
Trustless implementation would allow Bitcoin holders to capitalize on their hodlings from things like Compound, CDP’s, Uniswap, etc…

#### 🎟 Demo Wall — Badge Clearance 🎟



 *  **Problem:**  _Paywall, but not based on how much you pay, but your wallet demographic. Restricting access to people that meet specific criteria, demographic, etc…_ 
Early access to a specific feature on a platform is reserved for those with a wallet that is over 2 years old.
Chat rooms that are reserved for specific token holders. Governance meetings, etc…
Good starting point by 
[Brenner Spear](https://medium.com/@BrennerSpear)
 did an example for logging in can be found on 
[Github here](https://github.com/BrennerSpear/CryptoProof)
 .

#### ⛽️ Community Gas Pump ⛽️



 *  **Problem:**  _New users to crypto can’t get sent Dai because of the gas fees to use that Dai once it’s received._ 
Why not have a communal CDP for users to leverage when inviting new friends to the platform? The stakeholders of the communal CDP are given access to capital, while the end-user is getting a more frictionless experience.

#### 🤖 Make Chat Bots Great Again 🤖



 * Discord / Rocket Chatbot that can create a user on Wyre using our API.

 * Full flow verification and onboarding to be able to use all the Dapps coming alive in the crypto ecosystem.

 * Have an onboarding bot for each community that could increase adoption, while accumulating incentives for the sign-ups, that can be pooled and returned to the community.
Had something else in mind? Awesome! Give us a buzz, and we’d love to help you out and give feedback :)
