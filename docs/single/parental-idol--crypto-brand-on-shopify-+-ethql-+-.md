# Parental Idol  Crypto brand on Shopify + EthQL + deployed NFT + 3D printed design

I integrated the centralised and decentralised along with the physical and digital!
A genuine project to be worked on post EthDenver, funds would be appreciated! <3
All done from my sofa in London, UK remotely!
Shout out the preset Kauri team there though!

So the plan is to make dank collectibles and automate asset transferring after wiring crypto payment gateways.

I learned about NFTs and ERC721, 0xcert framework, Shopify, 3D CAD design, EthQL's schema during this project!

The initial plan was to integrate SendWyre too but ran out of time! I will do that for sure straight after!
No Shopify fees through their centralised gateway, booooo!
