## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

The Alice protocol helps donors track what impact their money makes when they give to charity. We built the Impact Curator to help vet projects before they can fundraise on Alice, and ensure that they are of a high quality.  The Impact Curator provides users with amazing UX: intuitive UI, responsive data rendering with Vuex state manager, minimised gas costs and faster confirmation times thanks to the Skale sidechain, which also avoids clogging the mainnet with a high number of TCR-related voting transactions.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

Vue.js, Vuex, Solidity, Truffle, Skale, Material design

## Smart contract components

- Voting token contract (ERC20)
- Proxy wallet: simplifies UX by wrapping the staking and application/challenge actions (instead of requiring two separate transactions as the ERC20 standard does not allow the atomic combination of transfers and action initiation)
- Project registry: registers charity projects, contains the voting logic (simple majority vote for now) and token distribution logic (loser's stake is split amongst voting curators)
