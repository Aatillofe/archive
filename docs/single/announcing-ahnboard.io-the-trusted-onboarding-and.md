title: Announcing Ahnboard.io — The Trusted Onboarding & Support Platform for Decentralized Applications
summary: By now, we are all acutely aware of the usability challenges that face decentralized applications. Where centralized web architecture has a created a host of intuitive design patterns and a familiar user experience flow, the decentralized world has lagged — with usability as the trade off. Users are expected to adopt a whole new paradigm — plunge into an unknown world of gas, MetaMask, wrapped ETH, “Token Allowance”, hardware wallets, and dozens of other technical jargon-fueled crypto concepts.

# Announcing Ahnboard.io — The Trusted Onboarding & Support Platform for Decentralized Applications



----

By now, we are all acutely aware of the usability challenges that face decentralized applications.
Where centralized web architecture has a created a host of intuitive design patterns and a familiar user experience flow, the decentralized world has lagged — with usability as the trade off.
Users are expected to adopt a whole new paradigm — plunge into an unknown world of gas, MetaMask, wrapped ETH, “Token Allowance”, hardware wallets, and dozens of other technical jargon-fueled crypto concepts.
 
**Introducing Ahnboard.io**
 
Ahnboard’s mission is to onboard, educate, and support the end users of the decentralized economy.
To support this vision Ahnboard is rolling out two products:



 * Ahnboard Support (Alpha)— This is an embedded chat widget that outsources your dApp’s support to utilize Ahnboard’s world class support agents. **We are launching Ahnboard Support today.**  [Get started](mailto:alex@ahnboard.io?subject=Hello)  **with a free three day trial of 24/7/365 world class support.** 

 * Ahnboard Flow — Can’t say too much here yet, but we’re excited for what’s next!
Ahnboard is chain-agnostic. While our initial efforts are geared towards supporting dApps built on Ethereum, we foresee aiding many types of apps in the future — dApps built on other chains, lightning applications, atomic swap focused apps, and apps we cannot even conceive of yet.
 
**Initial Support Research**
 
From our initial research looking at 0x relayers, NFT / collectibles marketplaces, and games built on Ethereum, about 80% of dApp support issues can be solved ahead of ticket time.
Most issues are caused by a misunderstanding of general crypto concepts like gas or wrapped ETH— not due to app-specific errors.
Through in-app, preemptive, and timely support responses, Ahnboard Support helps alleviate the overwhelming first time experience many new users face — helping drive more conversions and active users for your dApp.
Let us handle your support while you build.
