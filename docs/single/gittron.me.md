## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
The main purpose of Gittron is a gamified funding mechanism that adds passive income to support the further development of open-source projects. By supporting a verified Prime Bot on Gittron, you're sending funds directly to the project and receiving a Support Bot NFT as a thank you. The Gittron framework and its gamified funding mechanism could be applied to other kinds of impact projects. We do think taking a repo of code and generating programatic dna off of that is pretty cool though. Any data source could be used though. More info and live app at https://gittron.me
