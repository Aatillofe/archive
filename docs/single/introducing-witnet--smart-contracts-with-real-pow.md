### Meet the "oracle problem"

Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize business by creating _smart contracts_ that, unlike paper contracts, are impossible to breach.
However, up until now, smart contracts are completely isolated from the rest of the Internet. This is called **‚Äúthe oracle problem‚Äù** .

### The solution: a decentralized oracle network

The **Witnet protocol** connects smart contracts to **any data source** available online. Sport results, stock prices, weather forecasts or even other blockchains.
The protocol works thanks to a **distributed network** of mining nodes ‚Äî called **witnesses** ‚Äî who earn Wit tokens as a **reward** for retrieving web data and reporting it directly to the smart contracts.

### Wit: a minable token

Witnesses are also in charge of **validating transactions** in the network and bundling them into **blocks** that get appended to the blockchain periodically.
In doing so, they collect **transaction fees** and **block rewards** .

### Decentralized and fair by default

The probability for every witness to be assigned tasks or mine new blocks is directly proportional to their past performance in terms of honesty: **their reputation** .
The Witnet protocol is designed to make Wit mining viable even on commodity hardware, thus guaranteeing **fairness** and **decentralization** .

### 100% truth, 0% trust

Data provided by Witnet is reliable not because of authority but because it comes from **anonymous witnesses** who are **incentivized to remain honest** and to **compete** each other for rewards.
In addition, **veracity** of this data is guaranteed by a **consensus algorithm** that detects fraudsters, who are immediately punished.

### Compatible with existing smart contract platforms

Witnet complements (and completes!) all existing smart contract platforms like Ethereum thanks to **‚Äúbridge nodes‚Äù** .
Here‚Äôs an article explaining how Ethereum <> Witnet bridge nodes will work in practice:

### The door to a world where history is no longer written by the victors

Witnet will enable the creation of **Digital Knowledge Arks** : decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant and eternal archives of humanity‚Äôs most relevant digital data. In short, _‚Äúdecentralized Archive.org‚Äù_ .
You can read more about Digital Knowledge Arks in this other article:

### Brought to you by an unstoppable team of makers
Witnet is an open source project devised by [Stampery](https://stampery.com) , the leaders of blockchain-powered data certification. **The protocol is being developed by Witnet Foundation in collaboration with a community of independent contributors** .

Ever since Stampery was founded in 2014, they have been on a mission: **replacing blind trust with mathematical proof** . Witnet is the next step towards this goal.
Stampery is backed by top venture capital funds and angel investors, including **Tim Draper** and **Blockchain Capital** .
The Stampery team has also been involved in the development of [Aragon](https://aragon.one) , [Trailbot](https://trailbot.io) , [Mongoaudit](https://mongoaud.it) and [Loqui IM](https://loqui.im) .
