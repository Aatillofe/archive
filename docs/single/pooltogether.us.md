## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Over $80 billion dollars is spent on lottery tickets in the United States each year. At the same time, 40% of Americans do not have $400 of cash saved. PoolTogether flips these economics providing a smart contract allowing people to pool their saved money with the chance for one saver to win the interest from all the pooled money. This maintains the incentives of a lottery without the losses. This is a crucial mechanism to lift millions out of poverty in the United States and the rest of the world.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
We've built a smart contract using Solidity on the Rinkeby network. Our front-end is built in React JS and we've integrated with Rhombus as our random number generating oracle, Fortmatic for our Dai & ETH wallet, The Graph to pull key market return rates from Compound.Finance, and we're leveraging open Zeppelin libraries. 

## Track for which you’re submitting (Open or Impact)
- Impact

## All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
- Formatic 
- The Graph 
- Rhombus
