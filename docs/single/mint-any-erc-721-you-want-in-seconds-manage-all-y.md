### What is Mintable
 
[Mintable](https://mintable.app)
 is a dApp we’ve built to support the growing use cases of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It’s a free service that lets you mint any information as an ERC-721 token on the blockchain. Mintable also allows anyone who owns an ERC-721 to freely manage their tokens. This support extends to almost all of the ERC-721s in existence. Browsing unowned tokens is also a key feature, allowing you to easily pursue all of the ERC-721s created on the blockchain.
The dApp’s namesake comes from the fact that it’s a generator allowing you to 
**mint any ERC-721 you want**
 and have complete ownership and access to it; all within 30 seconds.

### Why did we make it?
In the next year — the Ethereum blockchain will have over 200+ NFT games operating — with thousands upon thousands of players each. Everyone of these players has digital items, with no central place to manage them.
> It’s like playing an MMORPG without a bank or inventory. You need somewhere to manage, see, view, interact with your assets

Mintable is here to fix that problem. Having been in the ERC-721 space since the beginning — I realized this is something all participants need and can benefit from. We all need a way to manage our 721 assets — a way that doesn’t include using ABI codes and complex addresses (if our grandmothers can’t do it, then its not going to be mass adopted).
So for the past 4 months we have been working hard to solve all the problems with current ERC-721 ecosystems. Such as:



 * Transferring and exchanging your items — Most places provide a very meek interface for transfers — if they even provide anything at all!

 * Browsing the items and their value — Try to find your Gods Unchained token ID…. go ahead…. I’ll wait.

 * Selling and Collecting — Where can you display a shopping list of items you want? Or sell your own items on a DEX?

### What you can do on Mintable
Mintable will be the easiest way for you to interact with your digital items. Watch the gifs below!

### Compatible with Mobile Wallets
You can use mintable on any browser 
**without a wallet to view and look up information.**
 
You need a wallet connected to send transactions and mint items.
 
**But we work with the major mobile wallets! Here is an example using Coinbase Wallet**

### What’s coming next?
We are adding in the coming months:



 * User accounts to show off your collectibles publicly, or to just manage your own items privately

 * Testing advanced features coming in the full launch

 * API for both storing information and for businesses to connect with Mintable

 * Testing the Decentralized Smart contract exchange for 721s.

### How can I help?
You can always donate to speed up production! We will have a donation contract set up soon so you can just send some ETH to it whenever you want if you want to support us!
 
_Maybe we will add some gift or ERC-721 as a thank you?_
