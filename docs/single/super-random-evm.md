## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Decent: uses blockhashes and onchain data to generate simple random uint256 numbers that can be slightly manipulated by miners.

Ultra is a bit more complicated but very safe. It is an ownerless clone of cryptokitties breeding algorithm, but without kitties. It requires the user asking for a random number to choose a future block. Later, during or after that block is mined, the unpredictable hash of the chosen block is used in conjunction with other previously generated random numbers to generate a new random uint256 via another hash.

## Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
