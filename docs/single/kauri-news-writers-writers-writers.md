## Newsletter

Behind the scenes the Kauri team is
  working on a large new release
  consisting of a total redesign, and
  a lot of new features to suit
  readers and writers and create a
  platform optimized for technical
  content. As part of this we've
  organized our rapidly growing
  newsletter subscribers based on the
  interests and roles subscribers
  specified at sign up. This means you
  will start seeing content based on
  those preferences, and more specific
  suggestions for you to follow. If
  you're not sure what you chose, update your preferences and watch that inbox.

  In the meantime, here's some juicy
  content from across Kauri and the
  internet for you to enjoy.

## Blockwhat?

An older post crossed our path in the past couple of weeks from Preethi
Kasireddy called "[how does Ethereum work anyway](https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40preethikasireddy%2Fhow-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369)".
While it's not important for all programmers to understand the machines
that their code runs upon, Ethereum is often somewhat different, and it
can be helpful to understand what's going on under the surface.

 Here's a few posts that complement the one above well:

-   [Learn how a blockchain works by creating your own](https://kauri.io/article/92034a0c23ed4cb4a6ca959e0a4b78b9)
-   [What is a consensus protocol?](https://kauri.io/article/1c2c9e3a3db0461584757a60ca2424a9)
-   [A deep dive into the Ethereum Virtual machine](https://kauri.io/article/b4a6d12332bd4ad58535ac2d59d95dff/v1/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-(evm)-part-1:-introduction)

## Solid Solidity

Solidity-based smart contracts underpin a large amount of dapps, but how
well do you really know the language and it's features?

-   [Create modularity in smart contracts with libraries](https://itnext.io/libraries-and-using-for-in-solidity-5c954da04128) and [even more about libraries](https://kauri.io/article/bb7efad0f7204a67aa6fa2b71b9641bc/v1/all-you-should-know-about-libraries-in-solidity)
-   [How do loops, a fundamental of many programming languages work?](https://blog.b9lab.com/getting-loopy-with-solidity-1d51794622ad)
-   [Want to know if your contracts meet best practice guidelines? Try Solhint](https://kauri.io/article/2ff86d30589b4832ad90f6c87c08fbea/v8/lint-your-solidity-contracts-with-solhint)

## A documentation crash course

Perhaps a bit meta, but we started a community for those wanting to
learn tips and techniques for improving documentation and technical
writing work. There's a few posts waiting there for you right now, with
more to follow soon. **If you're interested in becoming a moderator of
the community, let us know**.

-   [Why write documentation in the first place](https://kauri.io/article/203c87d1ee4b4444b0139fe054f28607/v1/why-write-documentation)
-   [How to structure documentation](https://kauri.io/article/cb1cad8db083475389718cbea3217db2/v1/documentation-structure)

## And Finally…

We have mostly focussed on written content on our journey so far, but have discussed hosting other media, including video tutorials. Another increasingly popular media format is live coding, [something Austin Griffith has tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlIcqsuSh10) with success in the Ethereum community.

Would you ever try this yourself?If you're interested in creating a live streaming setup, [we came across this great tutorial recently](https://dev.to/jeremycmorgan/getting-started-with-live-coding-pgf).

We wonder if there would be any interest in live documenting or blog writing?
