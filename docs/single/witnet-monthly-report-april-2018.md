For those new to Witnet and would like a primer, [read this 3 minutes primer](https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-smart-contracts-with-real-power-f79e326da3a4), or this piece about [why a network of decentralized oracles is needed](https://medium.com/witnet/why-do-we-need-a-decentralized-oracle-network-91ba455d074d)

 
Hi there, Witnet community! As you might know, every month we update you on our work towards the milestones 
[set in our project roadmap](https://republic.co/witnet)
 . Today we want to share what we have been up to over the last month, the challenges we have met and 
**the progress we have made towards our first milestone: the Witnet prototype**
 .

## ‚òØÔ∏è Partnerships
We‚Äôre really glad to announce we have agreed on a 
**partnership with Reflective Ventures**
 , a 
****
 venture firm that originates from an ongoing strategic partnership with 
[RChain Cooperative](https://www.rchain.coop/)
 . RChain is a third-generation blockchain applications platform whose 
**vision for the future of smart contracts**
 is very aligned with ours, a topic we‚Äôll explore on a following post.
 
**The partnership includes $3 million**
 for operational and engineering capital in order to 
**continue the development of the decentralized oracle network and bridge nodes to interact with the RChain platform**
 . The 
**RChain bridge**
  
**nodes**
 will be operational as soon as Witnet‚Äôs mainnet goes live, together with 
**bridges for Ethereum and for a decentralized storage protocol**
 . We‚Äôre very excited about the future we are building together!

## üíú Team
Over the past month 
[we have interviewed Daniele](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-daniele-witnets-operations-lead-6a72c8da8268)
 , our Operations Lead, to know about 
**his views regarding the future of Witnet**
 . A great read for anyone interested in his background participating in the cypherpunk movement as well as founding and investing in various startups.
We‚Äôve also 
[interviewed Johann](https://medium.com/witnet/team-insights-johann-witnets-rust-developer-1d5f79a0d5bc)
 , who is one of our 
**Back End Engineers**
 and a very interesting developer to work with. To learn about his role 
**working with Rust**
 , his healthy lifestyle and how much he 
**loves learning**
 , check out the full post!
Over the past weeks, we‚Äôve 
**hired three engineers to accelerate the development of the prototype**
 . You‚Äôll get to know them really soon through the 
[Team Insights](https://medium.com/witnet/tagged/team)
 we‚Äôll publish as they join us over the next days.
 
**We still have** [open positions](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs)
 , so if you are aware of the impact a decentralized oracle network will have on the crypto space, be sure to 
[check them out](https://angel.co/witnet-foundation-1/jobs)
 !

## üîß Product
 
[In our last Monthly Report](https://medium.com/witnet/witnet-monthly-report-march-2018-cf79a2cf859d)
 , we outlined the 
**functionalities that will make up the prototype**
 , and the roadmap for their launch. Right now, 
**we‚Äôre building the foundations for both the full server software and the desktop client.**
 We are intensively working on the 
**full protocol specification**
 , which we are shaping up in a series of 
[Witnet Improment Proposal (WIP)](https://github.com/aesedepece/WIPs/blob/wip-chain/wip-adansdpc-chain.md)
 documents.
On a technical note, 
**we will be eventually using React instead of Vue**
 for the desktop client. We love how Vue works but 
**React is superior when it comes to compatibility with other components in our stack**
 . Also, there is a huge talent pool of React developers worldwide for us to tap into.

That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been working on over the last month! Please let us know what you think of the recent developments by 
**sharing your thoughts**
 with the team.
