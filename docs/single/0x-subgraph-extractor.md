## Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
This repository provides a library that queries 0x events from a 0x-subgraph deployed on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/).

Unlike the [0x-event-extractor](https://github.com/0xTracker/0x-event-extractor) or extracting event logs via the `getLogsAsync` method of [0x.js](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/0x.js), this client does not require a server and allows event filtering beyond the indexed event arguments (i.e. `makerAddress`, `feeRecipientAddress`, `orderHash` for the Fill event).
