## Detailed Project Description
Play cross-chain pacman in your browser. Its a proof-of-concept where one user can choose to play over Zilliqa blockchain and other one can play over Ropsten test network (Ethereum). The game seamlessly records who is winning and allows the swap of a digital sword to the winner. Along with Zilliqa and Ethereum, the game is currently using browser's own local storage as an off-chain oracle. Next task is to move this oracle to an IPFS based database such as maybe Orbit-db.
