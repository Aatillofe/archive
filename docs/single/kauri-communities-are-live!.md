**With Communities, you can create effective developer onboarding experiences by:**

Check out our very first community, [Ethereum for Java Developers](https://kauri.io/community/5d2f30daaba2920001c82409). This community is led by team members from [PegaSys](https://pegasys.tech),  [Web3Labs](https://web3labs.com),  [IOBuilders](https://io.builders/), and our very own [Greg Jeanmart](https://kauri.io/public-profile/f0f15cedc719b5a55470877b0710d5c7816916b1) and [Craig Williams](https://kauri.io/public-profile/4d91838268f6d6d4e590e8fd2a001cd91c32e7a4).
