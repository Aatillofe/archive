# Betoken is Live on Mainnet!

![](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQaEniKpUcFjDaYoqByEJ3CP6PUC9rxrinhzRksEh1vHi)


### [Get started](https://betoken.fund/start.html) with the first crowd-powered crypto asset management protocol. Powered by [Kyber](https://kyber.network/), [Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/dai), and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).

Today, we are beyond excited to announce the launch of
[Betoken](https://betoken.fund/), a fund management protocol that will not only
transform how people invest in cryptocurrencies, but also provide thousands of
open job opportunities to crypto-traders.

By staking [Kairo tokens
](https://betoken.gitbook.io/docs/manage-the-fund/what-is-kairo)‚Äî Betoken‚Äôs
non-transferable reputation token ‚Äî Betoken‚Äôs fund managers collectively &
actively maintain a single portfolio consisting of 70+ Ethereum-based
cryptocurrencies, as well as margin positions of Ether, Wrapped BTC, BAT, KNC,
REP, and ZRX. Connecting your capital into this pooled portfolio is as easy as
clicking a button to receive [Betoken share
tokens](https://betoken.gitbook.io/docs/connect-your-capital/what-is-betoken-share-token)
‚Äî representing your ownership in the Betoken fund.

**Betoken uses a meritocratic system** that automatically allocates the most
funds to the managers with the best track record, and also pays them the most
commissions. This tightly couples the managers‚Äô interests ‚Äî earning commissions
‚Äî with the users‚Äô interests ‚Äî putting at work their money and saving time. We
believe this will **make magic happen**.

[Website](https://betoken.fund/).

> But wait, there‚Äôs more!

To celebrate our launch, we want to highlight some of the cool stuff you can do
on Betoken.

#### Betoken is a child of the DeFi ecosystem

Betoken is an open-source, community-owned, permissionless, and
censorship-resistant protocol that embraces the Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
movement. It is deeply integrated with many other DeFi protocols. Find out about
the details below!

##### **Instant liquidity and quick user onboarding with Kyber Network**

Kyber Network is a liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from a wide
range of reserves, allowing Betoken managers to trade instantly.

It‚Äôs also a perfect solution for onboarding new users who want to connect their
capital or become a manager since it allows users to pay with any of the 70+
cryptocurrencies supported.

For example, a user might use WBTC to deposit their funds into Betoken but
Betoken stores its funds in DAI to keep the value stable. Kyber Network is used
here to make the conversion.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Betoken uses Kyber Network to onboard new users without frictions.</span>

##### Decentralized margin positions with up to 4x leverage

Betoken makes it easy for the fund managers to create leveraged long or short
positions in [WBTC](https://www.wbtc.network/), ETH, KNC, BAT, REP, and ZRX. We
built a noncustodial margin trading platform on top of Fulcrum and Compound.

[Fulcrum](https://fulcrum.trade/#/) is a financial primitive enabling margin
trading with up to 4x leverage on Betoken.

[Compound](https://compound.finance/) is a decentralized protocol which
establishes money markets with algorithmically set interest rates based on
supply and demand, allowing Betoken managers to perform margin trading with up
to 1.5x leverage long and up to 0.5x leverage short.

**Note**: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is the first ERC20 token backed 1:1 with
Bitcoin. It‚Äôs completely transparent, 100% verifiable, and supported by leading
projects. [More here](https://www.wbtc.network/).

##### Bringing stability and accountability with DAI stablecoin

Betoken use MakerDAO‚Äôs DAI stablecoin to store value, handle its transparent
bookkeeping, and distribute profits and commissions to its users.
[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a decentralized autonomous organization
(DAO) comprised of a decentralized stablecoin (Dai), collateral loans, and
community governance.

##### The Graph Protocol integration

We‚Äôve seen the challenges in getting data off Ethereum and the issue in terms of
user experience. For this reason, we‚Äôve focused our time on the integration of
[@graphprotocol](http://twitter.com/graphprotocol), a decentralized ecosystem
with a powerful API that will load Betoken lightning fast. We‚Äôll release it on
Tuesday, July 30, 2019. #NoMoreSpinner.

#### **Betoken trading contest üèÜ with 1,000 USD in prizes**

We‚Äôre introducing our fund managers trading contest in partnership with Kyber
Network. We aim to reward our best fund managers during the first month, with
prizes in \$KNC.

The top **10 managers** who produce the **best returns** in July will win the
following prizes:

- ü•á 1st manager: **500** **USD worth of KNC**
- ü•à 2nd manager: **150** **USD worth of KNC**
- ü•â 3rd manager: **100** **USD worth of KNC**
- ü¶Ñ 4th-10th managers: **35** **USD worth of KNC each**

The competition begins on Thursday, July 4th, 2019, in our
[dApp](https://betoken.fund/portal/#/dashboard) and will last 27 days. The
result will be announced right after the [management
phase](https://betoken.gitbook.io/docs/betoken-investment-cycle) ends and the
prizes will be distributed in **\$KNC **immediately.

##### Show off your trading performance

One of our favorite features on Betoken is [the
leaderboard](https://betoken.fund/portal/#/rankings). It tracks managers‚Äô
performance and ranks them. Managers‚Äô performance is a form of reputation that
is used heavily in our [Incentivized
Meritocracy](https://github.com/Betoken/Whitepaper/blob/master/BetokenWhitepaper.md#introduction).

#### Conclusion

As we mentioned in many posts during the last 18 months, **Betoken‚Äôs goal is to
create more access to better, cheaper, and more open financial services ‚Äî no
matter who you are, where you live, what you do, or how much you have. Our hope
is to build a mainstream and self-regulated open financial system.** We‚Äôre
thrilled to finally launch Betoken and bring that future just a little closer.

#### Disclaimer

Nothing herein constitutes an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to
buy, any securities or tokens.

Betoken enables capital connection and managing using smart contracts which are
open source. Betoken does not take custody of tokens and is only a collaborative
hub for users connecting their capital and managers. Betoken is not a licensed
bank, broker-dealer, investment advisor or an exchange. Betoken uses partner
protocols (Kyber, Compound, Fulcrum by bZx, Maker DAO) to power its own
ecosystem.

**üíÄ This project is in beta. Use at your own risk.**
